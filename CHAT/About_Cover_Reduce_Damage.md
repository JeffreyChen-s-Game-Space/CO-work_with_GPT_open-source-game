> * Here's a simple example of how to reduce damage taken by a unit when it is behind cover:
```python
import random

# Define constants
COVER_BONUS = 0.5  # Percentage of damage reduction when behind cover

# Define a function to calculate damage
def calculate_damage(damage, cover):
    if cover:
        # If the unit is behind cover, reduce the damage by the cover bonus
        reduced_damage = damage * (1 - COVER_BONUS)
        # Randomly vary the damage by up to 20%
        damage_range = reduced_damage * 0.2
        final_damage = random.uniform(reduced_damage - damage_range, reduced_damage + damage_range)
        return final_damage
    else:
        # If the unit is not behind cover, return the original damage
        return damage

# Example usage
damage = 100  # Original damage
is_behind_cover = True  # Whether the unit is behind cover or not

# Calculate the final damage taken
final_damage = calculate_damage(damage, is_behind_cover)

# Print the final damage taken
print("Final damage taken: ", final_damage)
```
> * In this example, we define a constant COVER_BONUS that represents the percentage of damage reduction when the unit is behind cover. 
> * We then define a function calculate_damage that takes in the original damage and a boolean value representing whether the unit is behind cover or not.
> * Inside the function, we check if the unit is behind cover. If it is, we calculate the reduced damage by multiplying the original damage by (1 - COVER_BONUS). 
> * We then randomly vary the damage by up to 20% to simulate some variability in the actual damage taken. 
> * If the unit is not behind cover, we simply return the original damage. 
> * To use this function, you can call calculate_damage with the original damage and a boolean value representing whether the unit is behind cover or not.
> * The function will return the final damage taken, which you can then use in your game logic.
