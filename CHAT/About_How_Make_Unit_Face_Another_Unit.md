> * you can use the Transform.LookAt method. Here's how you can do it:
> * Create two game objects representing your characters.
> * Attach a script to the character you want to face towards the other character.
> * In the script, create a reference to the other character's transform component.
> * Use the LookAt method of the character's transform component to make the character face towards the other character's position.

using UnityEngine;

public class FaceOtherCharacter : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform otherCharacter;

    void Update()
    {
        // Make this character face towards the other character
        transform.LookAt(otherCharacter.position);
    }
}
```
> GPT:
> * In this code, the otherCharacter variable is a reference to the transform component of the other character. In the Update method, the LookAt method is called on the character's transform component to make it face towards the other character's position.
> * This code assumes that both characters are on the same plane, so you may need to adjust the Y-axis position of the other character's transform component to get the correct facing direction.
